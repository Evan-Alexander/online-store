# FoodLog

A an app where users may track the food they ate for the day, log a description, and keep track of their calories.

# User Story â€¦

* Log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* Ability to view a list of foods I have logged.
* Options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I can click a food to edit its name, details or calories (for necessary changes and ... cheating!).
